Full-page illustrations as the name indicates occupy the entire page and reflect detailed scenes. The text is thoughtfully placed within these detailed backgrounds and finely designed characters to show the pivotal moments in your narrative. They transport children right into the heart of a story, make lasting impressions, and evoke memorable scenes that last a long time even after they close the book."

They frequently contain no or minimal background and are just the right piece to adorn chapter headings or reside in corners fabulously nestled within the text. Imagine a delicate little drawing of a butterfly beside a poem or a small, playful character greeting readers at the start of each chapter. Our children's book illustrators add magic to every page with expertly crafted spot illustrations. "

They contain more details and backgrounds than spot illustrations, but they do not overwhelm a story as full-page illustrations do. Think of depicting a lively scene in a bustling marketplace or a tranquil moment in a magical forest, our expert half-page illustrators enrich your story so that each scene becomes memorable and draws young readers into the world you’ve created."
